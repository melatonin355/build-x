- **Docker Host:** The machine (physical or virtual) on which the Docker daemon runs.

- **Networking (CNM):** Container Network Model (CNM) is a Docker networking abstraction layer that manages the networking between containers and the host system.

- **Storage (Graph):** The storage layer in Docker that manages images and container layers. This layer uses graph drivers to manage these layers.

- **libnetwork:** A library that handles network management for Docker. It provides the network plumbing for containers, allowing them to communicate with each other and with the host system.

- **Storage Driver:** A plugin-based storage management system for Docker images and container layers. It abstracts the underlying storage technology, allowing for multiple storage backends.

- **Container:** A lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient software unit that runs an application and its dependencies. It shares the host's kernel but has its own isolated file system, networking, and process space.

-  **cgroups:** Control Groups (cgroups) are a Linux kernel feature that allows for the isolation and management of system resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O, etc.) used by processes or containers.

- **Namespaces:** Linux kernel feature that provides isolation between processes and containers by creating a separate view of the system (e.g., process ID, network, mount points, etc.).
